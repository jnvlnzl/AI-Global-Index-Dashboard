# AI-Global-Index-Dashboard
This is a dashboard created in Tableau on the AI Global Index dataset by Kateryna Meleshenko.

The dataset includes the global AI index itself and seven indicators affecting the index on 62 countries, as well as general information about the countries (region, cluster, income group, and political regime). The indicators are divided into three groups: Implementation (Talent, Infrastructure, Operating Environment), Innovation (Research, Development), and Investment (Government strategy, Commercial). 

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), regression, and clustering analysis were done before creating the dashboard.
